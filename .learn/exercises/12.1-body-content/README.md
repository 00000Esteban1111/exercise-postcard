## `12.1` Postcard-body content

What elements should be inside the postcard body? Can you try and identify them, based on the HTML tags we mentioned earlier?

Possible options: Headings (h1, h2, h3, etc.), Paragraphs, Images, Divisions, Inputs, Checkbox, etc.

## üìù Instructions

Create the neceary HTML tags to finish the `.post-card` content and apply the necesary styles to make them look like the picture.

Think about the layout for those tags:

   + The inputs are going to be one on top of each other.

   + The text inputs are also going to be one on top of each other.

Also think about what styles are you going to apply:

   + The first `<p>` does not need a margin top.

   + `.body-left` and `.body-right` must have padding to separate text from the edges of the boxes.

   + The inputs have a `border-bottom` in grey but no borders on the sides and top, try `border: none` then `border-bottom`.

   + The paragraphs and/or paragraphs may have a particular `font-size`.

This is how your website should look like so far:
