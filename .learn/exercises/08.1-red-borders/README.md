## `08` Styles for debugging

To be able to debug better the application, we strongly recomend to include the following styles inside your style.css.

```css
* {
	border: 1px dashed red;
	min-height: 10px;
}
```

This code is going to add a red dashed border to every element in the website making them easier to see and debug.
